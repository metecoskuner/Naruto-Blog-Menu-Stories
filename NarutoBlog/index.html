      <h3>The World of Chakra</h3>
      
      <p>
        Chakra is the cornerstone of all jutsu in the Naruto universe, representing a form of spiritual and physical
        energy that ninja manipulate to perform their abilities. This mystical energy is a blend of the body’s physical
        energy and the mind’s spiritual energy. Every ninja must master the control and application of chakra to execute
        their techniques effectively. The chakra system is fundamental to the understanding of how ninjas operate within
        their world.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Basic Chakra:</strong> The base chakra is composed of physical and spiritual energy. Physical energy
          is derived from the body's vitality and stamina, while spiritual energy comes from mental focus and training.
          The combination of these energies results in chakra, which is used for various jutsu.</li>
        <li><strong>Chakra Nature Transformations:</strong> Ninja can manipulate chakra to align with different
          elemental natures: Fire, Water, Earth, Wind, and Lightning. Each ninja usually has a natural affinity for one
          or more of these elements, influencing their preferred combat style and techniques.</li>
        <li><strong>Advanced Chakra Techniques:</strong> Advanced techniques include Sage Mode and Tailed Beast
          transformations, which require unique methods of chakra control and utilization. Sage Mode, for instance,
          involves harmonizing one's chakra with nature energy, while Tailed Beasts grant massive amounts of chakra to
          their hosts, or Jinchūriki.</li>
